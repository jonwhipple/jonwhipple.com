				<h2>First Things</h2>
				<p class="date">2022-07-12</p>
				<p>How do you do any kind of discovery process for your own practice? Are you discovering your practice, or yourself? And if it's yourself –because you're inseparable from the things you do– do you know yourself enough to find some form of graphic identity?</p>
				<p>Oh, wait a minute. I should back up. Let me bring you up to speed. Let me slow down.<p>
				<p>The part I've left out here is–, well, maybe I've left out a few things. I should probably explain how a project happens. How I try to undertake a project large or small. Then I'll get into some details.</p>
				<p>Usually there's some sort of engagement process that happens where a client is looking for a designer and the designer is trying to find a client. If this is handled with deftness and clarity, maybe you'll get a good match between the work, the designer, and the client.</p>
				<p>In this particular case though, the client (me) has already selected the designer (me). Sure it sounds a little glib, but speaking candidly as the designer I can assure you this client has, um, well, shall we say, <i class="highlight">exceptional</i> expectations?</p>
				<p>Part of the engagement process reveals what the client is after and what the designer brings to help the client.</p>
				<p>Next there's some sort of discovery or research work the designer does in order to get some insight into the complete problem domain. <span class="highlight">This can be a hugely valuable thing for the client.</span> As the designer does this work, it's inevitable they will find the parts of your organization and operation that don't work as expected. It can reveal internal conflict, operational problems and missed opportunity. A client open to, and expecting, business expertise will find massive bonus value here in this opening stage.</p>
				<p><span class="highlight"><b>This is the point where we find ourselves.</b></span> (There are following steps such as design development, and implementation, but we'll get to those in coming days.)</p>
				<p>My first discovery is that <span class="highlight"><b><i>the engagement process was short-circuited</i></b></span>. This means there's no project brief from the client. There's no response or proposal of any sort from the designer either.</p>
				<p>There <b><i>are</i></b> vague notions, sure. Some poorly articulated ideas that everybody was dreaming up at various points during the day. Some rumination and, what the client says is "thinking hard", and what the designer portrays has "critical insights" and "massive inspiration". But in the end, there's no coherent expression by anybody about anything that's supposed to happen.</p>
				<p>This discovery alone is enough to send both parties back to their corners. The client needs to write some kind of brief and the designer needs to respond to that.</p>
				<p>Yeah. It's gonna be difficult, but I am going to try my best.</p>
				<p>
					<b>Note</b><br>
					Today I made a repo for this project. Probably not useful to anybody to actually use for anything, but it's how I am going to track changes over time and give myself a little safety net.

				<h2>Kickoff</h2>
				<p class="date">2022-07-10</p>
				<p>Let's face it. I've left the site way way too long.</p>
				<p>A lot has happened in the years since I made the site, a lot has changed, and a few updates really aren't enough.</p>
				<p>I gave this some thought. Well, a lot of thought. Probably way more than you might imagine. And I thought to myself <i>Self, you really need to redesign your website.</i> And then I thought to myself <i>But really, what for? What are you actually offering? What is it you're doing? Or saying for that matter?</i></p>
				<p>And I'm not gonna lie. I also thought to myself things even worse. Things like <i>You've pretty much ended your career by not doing anything you can show in a portfolio. You've been slogging through a bunch of technical work invisibly. What have you actually designed recently? Who are you kidding, you're way too old anyway.</i></p>
				<p>Well, it's easy to get lost down that path. It's an old habit. But there's the other part of me too. The perverse part of me that delights in some cruel joke I can play on myself. Or maybe it's the part of me that simply has to try.</p>
				<p>Regardless, my conversation changed to <i>Well you're gonna do it, <span class="highlight">so exactly what will you do?</span></i></p>
				<p>Well, this is what I am going to do. I am going to redesign this web site, and redesign everything that relates to it. <span class="highlight"><b>And I'm going to do it in the open and make a record of all the work.</b></span></p>
				<p>There are some other things that are important to me as well.</p>
				<p><span class="highlight">I want to have fun doing this.</span> I love doing design. This isn't going to be a chore. It's going to be an exercise of all the things I've learned in my career, and a re-discovery of the things I have forgotten.</p>
				<p><span class="highlight">I want to try things that I haven't tried before.</span> Seldom do you get an opportunity to exercise some new approach or technique. It's not often you really can stretch when you're doing client work for a specific goal. If your work is focused on helping the greatest number of people regardless of age or ability, your never really getting the opportunity to try anything in the unusual or extreme. But this is that opportunity. Even if it doesn't doesn't end up integrated into the final output, doing these kinds of things can serve as examples in some kind of portfolio, or as ongoing learning exercises.</p>
				<p><span class="highlight">I want to be thoughtful and do my personal best.</span> The goal isn't simply to get a new website. It's not really about reinvention either. It's really about taking my own medicine, and striving for my personal best.</p>
				<p>So in the upcoming days, weeks, and months, I'll be writing here, and posting images and notes. I hope that you join me and you find the journey rewarding and valuable.</p>
